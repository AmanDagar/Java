## This is a basic Banking Management System created by me which allows a bank to manages its branches and manage customers in those branches.
## It's purely based on Core Java conecpts and is not connected to any database.
## The purpose for this small project is to test my understanding of basic Java concepts such as OOPS concepts like encapsulation, and lots more.
## IntelliJ Idea is used to create the project.
